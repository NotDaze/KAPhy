# KAPhy
KAPhy (Pronounced "Kaffy") is a relatively lagless, somewhat functional physics engine for the Khan Academy Computer Science webpage environment.
It provides a lot of functionality. It does the seemingly impossible and utilizes rigid mass-spring shapes.
Despite this, it works pretty smoothly with the tests I've done so far.

Status: In Progress, Somewhat Usable

I'll update this README once I get something more complete.
